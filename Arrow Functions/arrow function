1.What is function?
   A function is a group of instructions, also known as a named procedure,
   used by programming languages to return a single result or a set of results.

2.Why function is need in programming?
    Reusability

Arrow function is used to reduce the characters
Instead of writing the below codes

Example:
==========
function test () {
  return 2;
}

We can simply write  as

test = () => 2;

Arrow functions are anonymous there is no way to give a name to arrow function

Benefits of using Arrow Functions:
=====================================

#1. Shorter Syntax
    Ref: Ex.1 in arrowFunction.js
  Syntax:
  ========

(parameters) => { statements }
A.If there is no parameters we can use
  () => { statements }
B.When there is only one parameter we can use the following (optional of using ())
  parameters => { statements }
C.If we are going to return only expression we can use:
  parameters => expression   (which is equivalent to the below code)

  function (parameters){
    return expression;
  }
D.How a json object is used in arrow Function
   x => {x: y} //won't work instead we should use the following
   x => ({x: y})


#2.Promises and this

p.then(function (v) {return v.id}) // instead of using then we can do it simply as

p.then(v => v.id)
